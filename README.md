# GNNs and algorithmically solvable tasks

This is an educational project with the goal of understanding the capabilities of GNNs and exploring their current theoretical foundations. The idea is to engineer a GNN that can solve specific graph problems for which algorithmic solutions already exist. Here's my motivation:

1. To the best of my knowledge, GNNs are currently not quite capable of solving non-trivial algorithmic tasks on graphs (see the Literature overview). By solving these tasks, we might discover new insights that could be useful for addressing well-established challenges in the field of GNNs.

2. If we succeed in step 1, it will be interesting to observe what the GNN actually learned, as it should have acquired some algorithmic knowledge.
