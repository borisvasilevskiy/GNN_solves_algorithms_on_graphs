# GNNs and algorithmically solvable tasks

This is an educational project which goal is to understand GNN capabilities and discover current theoretical grounds. The idea is to enginner a GNN that solves specific graph problem that have known algorithmic solution. Here's my motivation:
1. To my best knowledge, so far GNNs aren't quite capable of solving non-trivial algorithmic tasks on graphs (see the the [Literature overview](GNN_and_algorithmically_solvable_tasks.md)). Solving them might bring novelties that may be useful for the well-established GNN challenges.
2. If the step 1 succeeds, it will be interesting to see what it actually learned because it should've learned some algorithm.
